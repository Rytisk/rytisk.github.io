## **Me**

Well, mostly for me. 

I am a software engineer by profession, and once in a while, I notice that I'm having a hard time expressing myself during meetings or group discussions. Instead of explaining a concept or a problem clearly, I might create even more confusion. If I take my time and prepare beforehand, then it's not a problem, but in ad-hoc discussions where I need to just dump my knowledge of tech in a coherent way - that's where the problem lies.

Not so long ago, a colleague of mine was invited into a discussion unaware of the topic. He ended up explaining a concept I knew pretty well to the rest of the group, and I just thought, 'It's so easy to understand what he's saying.' How does one do that? Why doesn't he stammer and jump from one thought to another?

That's one of the main reasons I'm starting this blog. Writing is supposed to help with thisâ€”with expressing myself in a clearer way.

## **You**

I'm not sure about the scope of this blog or how long I will keep writing it, but it might be of interest to you. I will be writing about network programming, databases, Golang, other topics of interest, issues I run into, and my successes and failures.
